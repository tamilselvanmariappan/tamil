I have thought of doing morning workout to have healthy body. Let's see how it's goes :)
Below are the choices to-do. 
- Cycling
- Walking
- Joking
- Yoga
- Skipping
- Excercises or Gym
The hard part is wakeup in early morning with out any choice to do any of the above.
So, First plan to wake up earlier then do choice..
